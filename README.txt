This website is a work in progress and will hopefully change to be more functional by the end of the year.
I will showcase some of my work done in my CS courses and am planning to add/fix the following:

-Functional contact form
-Code editor
-Additional Pages

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
